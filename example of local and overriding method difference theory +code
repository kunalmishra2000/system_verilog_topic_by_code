// in this code child create own method beeacuse child are p=not possible to visiable outside of the class 
// so, in this we create child own memory for child class method

// invisiblity provide by local access modifier method
//  see this code

/*Child creates its own method

Child does not know base class has the same method

Because the base method is local

local makes it invisible

So no overriding happens

Child gets its own memory and method*/

  //  Child creates a new method
 // This method has no relation to base post()
 //Base method is invisible, so child doesn't even know it exists

   //pac is of type child
  //So compiler directly calls:
